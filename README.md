# DevOps Blast Radius Analyzer

An AI-powered DevOps change reviewer that predicts risk, blast radius,
and rollback steps before production changes are applied.

## Problem
DevOps changes often cause production incidents because teams do not
understand the blast radius of their changes.

## Solution
This tool uses a company-provided AI model as a constrained DevOps reviewer
to analyze proposed changes and provide structured risk analysis.

## MVP Scope
- Input: DevOps change (YAML / pipeline / config)
- Output: Risk level, impact, checks, rollback
